Application: RideFind

Team: Status 200

This software project solves the issue of users having too many separate and regularly used rideshare apps. We plan to build a web page that displays a mapping of the closest rideshare car available in your area regardless of the vendor. The goal is to allow users to see cars from all rideshare companies in the area and be able to click on the one they want which in turn would redirect them to the appropriate third party landing page for that car. We will call this project RideFind.
