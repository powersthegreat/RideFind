Application: RideFind

Team: Status 200

Description: This software project solves the issue of users having too many separate rideshare apps that are all used regularly. We plan to build a webpage the displays a mapping of the closest rideshare car available in your area based of a set of filters you will be able to input. The goal is to allow users to see cars form all rideshare companies in the area and be able to click on the one they want which in turn would redirect them to the appropriate third party landing page for that car. We will call this software project RideFind.
